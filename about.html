                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>At City Farm, we believe that everyone should have access to fresh, healthy, and sustainably grown produce. That's why we've dedicated ourselves to creating a community-driven urban farm that serves not just as a source of food, but
                        as a center for education and community engagement. </p>

                    <p>Our farm is located in the heart of the city, and we're proud to say that we've transformed what was once a vacant lot into a thriving farm that produces a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. We use sustainable growing practices,
                        including composting and rainwater harvesting, to ensure that our farm is as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>

                    <p>But City Farm is more than just a farm. We're also committed to providing education and outreach programs that help our community learn about healthy eating, sustainable agriculture, and environmental stewardship. Our programs include
                        workshops on topics such as composting, beekeeping, and urban gardening, as well as a variety of educational opportunities for students of all ages. </p>

                    <p>In addition to our farming and education programs, we also work to build community through events and volunteer opportunities. From our annual Harvest Festival to our weekly volunteer workdays, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive
                        space where everyone can come together to learn, grow, and give back.</p>

                    <p>We're passionate about what we do at City Farm, and we're always looking for ways to improve and expand our programs. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just getting started, we invite you to join us and be a part of our mission
                        to create a healthier, more sustainable, and more connected community.</p>
